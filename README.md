FabLab makes Blot - an open-source, browser-coded plotter :)

See (here)[./README-orig.md] for the original project README file.

# Challenges / To Do List:
Most of the initial challenges come from not having an original kit of parts and having to fabricate or source them directly. To begin to able to build the project, we aim to:

- source all parts on AliExpress (apart from the custom control and power boards)
- DONE: rework the control board as a through hole KiCad project (it's currently done in EasyEda as PCBA). Can be found (here)[./hardware/motor-control-board/circuit/controller_Kicad)
- have the power board made as fully assembled (PCBA)
- CNC mill the aluminium part
